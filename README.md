# GraphicsFinalProject
For this final we created a toon/cel shader in Unity to give the objects we created in the scene their own cartoony spin.
The sources we used were chapter 16 of the Halladay textbook which we used to get started with working in Unity, This site: https://roystan.net/articles/toon-shader/ which helped us understand the basics of toon shading where we changed the lighting pass as well as adding the combining it from what we learned from this site: https://nedmakesgames.medium.com/creating-custom-lighting-in-unitys-shader-graph-with-universal-render-pipeline-5ad442c27276 in a shader graph to hopefully add in some custom lighting to the shader.
